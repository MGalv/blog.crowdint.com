If you are using "RVM":http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/ in your machine (just as "Francisco showed":/2010/07/28/getting-started-with-rvm.html the other day) then you should take adventage of the "project .rvmrc":http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/workflow/rvmrc/#project feature.

Lets say your proyect is in the directory:

{% highlight bash %}
~/repo/myproject
{% endhighlight %}

And you have ruby-1.8.7 and ruby-1.9.2 in RVM and you want to use 1.9.2 ruby version in that project.

Then you can put this in your @~/repo/myproject/.rvmrc@ file:

{% highlight bash %}
rvm 1.9.2
{% endhighlight %}

So, every time you change to that project directory, *RVM will change to the specified ruby version*.

{% highlight bash linenos %}
chalofa [1.8.7]:~/repo/myproject$ ruby --version
  ruby 1.8.7 (2010-06-23 patchlevel 299) [x86_64-linux]

chalofa [1.8.7]:~/repo$ cd myproject/
chalofa [1.9.2]:~/repo/myproject$ ruby --version
  ruby 1.9.2dev (2010-07-11 revision 28618) [x86_64-linux]

chalofa [1.9.2]:~/repo/myproject$ cd ..
chalofa [1.8.7]:~/repo$ ruby --version
  ruby 1.8.7 (2010-06-23 patchlevel 299) [x86_64-linux]
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, first we are using Ruby version 1.8.7, after the change to our project directory, the version selected in the @.rvmrc@ is used: 1.9.2
Once you abandon the project directory, your default Ruby version will be used!

It even *works with gemsets* so you can have something like this in your @.rvmrc@ file:

{% highlight bash %}
rvm 1.9.2@blog
{% endhighlight %}

*And every time you cd into your directory, your ruby version and gemset will be changed :)*

h2. Final thoughs

Whether this file should or shouldn't be in your project repo is up to you, but IMO it should be ignored, creating the possibility to be defined by every user...

What do you think about that?
